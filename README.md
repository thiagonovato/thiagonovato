I am a software developer with 17 years of experience. I've worked with PHP for 8 years, developing websites with content management. I also developed some systems with Java using Spring Framework and in the last 4 years I have been studying and applying Javascript. For backend I use Node JS (and some frameworks with NestJS and AdonisJS), microservices with serverless/lambda/cloud functions/ azure functions, messaging services with Apache Kafka and Service Bus. For Frontend, I use reactJS in all projects, with or without frameworks, for example NextJS, and I use some libraries for styling like Material UI, Chackra UI, Tailwind CSS and styled-components. And I developed some mobile apps using React Native/Expo. I've worked in some startups and I'm used to working with agile methods like Scrum.
